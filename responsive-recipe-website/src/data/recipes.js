    ingredients: ['1 cup sugar', '1/2 cup butter', '1 tsp vanilla'], 
    prepTime: '15 mins', 
    cookTime: '25 mins',

    instructions: 'Start by creaming the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. This step is crucial as it incorporates air into the mixture, resulting in a lighter texture.

    title: 'Recipe 3', 
    image: placeholderImage, 
    ingredients: ['2 cups rice', '1 cup water', '1 tsp salt'], 
    prepTime: '20 mins', 
    cookTime: '30 mins', 
    totalTime: '50 mins', 
    instructions: 'Begin by rinsing the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil and add the salt. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot. Let it simmer until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork before serving. The key to perfect rice is to avoid lifting the lid during cooking, as this releases steam and affects the texture. Serve the rice as a side dish or as a base for your favorite main course. Bon appétit!'

    title: 'Recipe 4', 
    image: placeholderImage, 
    ingredients: ['1 lb chicken', '1/2 cup soy sauce', '1 tbsp honey'], 
    prepTime: '25 mins', 
    cookTime: '35 mins', 
    totalTime: '60 mins', 
    instructions: 'Marinate the chicken in a mixture of soy sauce and honey for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat, resulting in a more flavorful dish. Preheat your oven to 375°F. Place the marinated chicken on a baking sheet and cook until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This step is important as it allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and tender chicken. Serve with your favorite sides and enjoy the savory and sweet flavors. Bon appétit!'

    ingredients: ['1 cup oats', '1/2 cup milk', '1 tbsp honey'], 
    prepTime: '30 mins', 
    cookTime: '40 mins', 
    totalTime: '70 mins', 
    instructions: 'Combine the oats, milk, and honey in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the oats are tender and the mixture has thickened. Pour into bowls and top with fresh fruit or nuts for added flavor and texture. The key to a perfect oatmeal is to cook it slowly, allowing the oats to absorb the liquid and become creamy. This dish is perfect for a hearty breakfast or a comforting snack. Bon appétit!'

    ingredients: ['1 cup pasta', '2 cups water', '1 tsp salt'], 
    prepTime: '35 mins', 
    cookTime: '45 mins', 
    totalTime: '80 mins', 
    instructions: 'Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Toss with your favorite sauce and serve immediately. The key to perfect pasta is to cook it just until it is tender but still firm to the bite. This ensures that it holds its shape and texture when tossed with the sauce. Serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and a side of garlic bread. Bon appétit!'
